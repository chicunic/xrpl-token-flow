# Trust Line Token

Trust Line Token is a fungible token mechanism on XRPL based on [Trust Lines](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/trust-line-tokens). Holders must establish a Trust Line with the Issuer before receiving tokens.

## Test Suites

### Basic Lifecycle (`basic.test.ts`)

Tests the full lifecycle: configure Issuer (DefaultRipple) → create Trust Line → Mint → Transfer → Burn → delete Trust Line.

```bash
pnpm test trust-line-token/basic
```

### AllowTrustLineClawback (`allow-trustline-clawback.test.ts`)

Tests [Clawback](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/clawback) functionality.

| Operation                         | Condition                      | Expected                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Issuer clawback from Bob          | AllowTrustLineClawback enabled | Success                                              |
| Issuer clawback exceeding balance | Clawback amount > balance      | Success (claws back entire balance)                  |
| Clear AllowTrustLineClawback      | Flag already set               | Transaction succeeds but flag remains (irreversible) |

```bash
pnpm test allow-trustline-clawback
```

### Check (`check.test.ts`)

Tests [XRPL Check](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/checks) functionality.

| Operation                 | Condition              | Expected              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Bob cashes Alice's check  | Check is valid         | Success               |
| Alice cancels check       | Sender cancels         | Success               |
| Bob cancels check         | Receiver cancels       | Success               |
| Bob cashes canceled check | Check already canceled | Failure (tecNO_ENTRY) |

```bash
pnpm test trust-line-token/check
```

### Check Burn via Issuer (`check-burn-via-issuer.test.ts`)

Tests using a [Check](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/checks) to burn tokens back to the issuer, bypassing [DepositAuth](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/depositauth) on the issuer.

| Operation                         | Condition             | Expected                             |

pnpm test trust-line-token/check-burn-via-issuer
```

### Credential Deposit Auth (`credential-deposit-auth.test.ts`)

```

### Deep Freeze (`deep-freeze.test.ts`)

Tests [Deep Freeze (XLS-77)](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/deep-freeze): a deep-frozen holder can neither send nor receive the token, while a regular freeze only blocks sending.

| Operation                              | Condition              | Expected                   |
