# Multi-Purpose Token (MPT)

Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) is a [new token standard](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/multi-purpose-tokens) on XRPL, lighter-weight than Trust Line Tokens. Issuers create an [MPToken Issuance](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/mptokenissuancecreate), and holders [Authorize (opt-in)](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/mptokenauthorize) to hold tokens without establishing a Trust Line.

## Test Suites

### Basic Lifecycle (`basic.test.ts`)

Tests the full lifecycle: create Issuance (with metadata) → Holder Authorize → Mint → Transfer → Burn → Unauthorize → Destroy Issuance.

```bash
pnpm test multi-purpose-token/basic
```
